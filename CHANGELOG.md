# Changelog

This file is the operator-facing release ledger. Every pull request adds one
line under `## Unreleased` with one of the allowed section labels, or
applies the `changelog-skip` label for a purely no-impact change. See ORC
policy Universal PR Essentials.

Allowed entry labels:

- `[BREAKING]` - incompatible API, data, deployment, or operator change.
- `[FEATURE]` - new user-visible or operator-visible capability.
- `[FIX]` - bug fix or compatibility repair.
- `[INTERNAL]` - tests, CI, docs, refactors, generated artifacts, or process.
- `[SECURITY]` - vulnerability fix, security control, or hardening change.

PR title prefix matches the highest-tier label added:
`[BREAKING]` -> `[major]`, `[FEATURE]` -> `[minor]`, others -> `[patch]`.
